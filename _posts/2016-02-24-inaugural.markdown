Congratulations! You are reading the first ever post on antlers.io. If you are reading this as it is released, you can look back on this moment and know you were one of the first people to witness the birth of something great. If you are reading this in the future, I admire your desire to find the post that started it all.

I have a lot of big plans for this site, and I'll do my best to make them happen.

Some real neat content you can look forward to:

* Blog Posts
* Comics
* Twitch Streams
* Podcasts
* Photography
* Any other neat things me and my friends can think of

Feel free to send feedback and ideas my way!

Yours Sincerely,
Frank Albenesius
